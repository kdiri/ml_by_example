The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing.

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n',\n",

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n',\n",

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary\\n-- \\nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \\nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \\n',\n",

This is\\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\\\GRBs\\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\\\GRBs\\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\\n\\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\\\GRBs (the BATSE\\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\\n   between the angular distributions of \\\\GRBs and comets\\' aphelia,\\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\\n   at least to some extent, true variations\\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\\\vov$\\n   test to both distributions.\\n\\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\\n   $\\\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\\\sim 800$\\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\\n   Currently,\\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\\n   found for the $\\\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\\\GRBs.\\n',\n",

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\\nRRA slew test.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n',\n",

These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).

I have had\\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P.

Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps.

GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

What would be the spectrum of an event which\\nconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black\\nholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets\\naren\\'t quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which\\nmodifies the spectrum.

       "  'From: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen)\\nSubject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together\\nOrganization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)\\nKeywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas\\nLines: 84\\n\\nI\\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I\\'ve encountered in 2 different\\nPEX implementations.  I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n\\n-- \\n===============================================================================\\nDave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com\\nApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com\\nAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen\\n',\n",

Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n\\n\\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \\njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \\nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \\n',\n",

Clarke\\n\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\\nOrig. Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\\narchives\\n\\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\\n\\nABOUT RON MILLER\\n\\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\\nspots.]\\n\\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\\nNational Air and Space Museum\\n\\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\\nSmithsonian* magazine\\n\\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\\n\\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \\n\\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\\n\\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\\n\\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\\n\\nORDERING INFORMATION\\n\\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\\n\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\nPO Box 9542\\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\\nUSA\\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\\nFax (407)951-3671\\n\\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\\nadditional book.  \\n\\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\\nadditional.

[....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\\n\\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\\nam not a diving expert).\\n\\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \\npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.

At the time,I felt \\nthat\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\'s?) had a lot in\\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\\'s Daedalus project for sending a\\nprobe to Barnard\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\nrelatively great distance.\\n---\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\nwell-equipped spacecraft.

I don\\'t see a realistic  prospect for\\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\\nthe DC flops, it\\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\n\\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\ndirection.  It doesn\\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It\\'s creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I\\'ve attended the last two IAFs.

But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n',\n",

Due to his\\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\\nAct.                      \\n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \\nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\\nAmerica back to the Moon.\\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \\nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\\nspring, 1993.\\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\\nby necessity, must choose.                    \\n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \\nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\\nand politicians.\\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\\nSociety).\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n\",\n",

Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has\\ninformed me that dust grains _aren\\'t_ good radiators in the far IR,\\nwhich is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field\\nfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.\\nSorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to\\ntake another ISM class :-(\\n\\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\\'d like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I\\'m just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n\\n-- \\n-----                                                    Michael Richmond\\n\"This is the heart that broke my finger.\"    richmond@astro.princeton.edu\\n\\n',\n",

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere\\n> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question\\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\\n\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

As far as commercialization, that is\\n>a long ways off.  ...\\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.

Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

It was a bit shorter\\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\\nbare-bones.\\n\\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\\n\\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \\n\\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\\n\\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\npart first.\\n\\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\n\\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\nthis point.\\n\\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\nto persue work on their own.\\n\\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\\ntrying to do something with it.  \\n\\nAnybody know anything further?\\nIs this really news?\\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n\\n                    John.\\n\",\n",

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\n\\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\\n \\n',\n",

Round\\ntrip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as\\n5000 kg in a Low Earth \"advertising\" orbit: Very roughly the\\nsame cost as a smallish billboard, therefore.

Today, most people would have to go 100 miles\\nor more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards\\non orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still\\n\"wild.\" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital\\nbillboards aren\\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of \\ngrowing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will\\nnot save your view of the night sky, because by the time \\nsuch ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble\\nfinding a place without street lights, where you can _see_\\nthe stars...\\n\\n>Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.

As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal.

The aim of Informatica is to open various\\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \\nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\\nand on the way to become significant.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\\n\\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  So, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\\n\\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\\n\\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\\npurple-colored glass object.\\n\\n    Hopefully this answers your question.

In a recent\\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\\nsaid:\\n\\n  \"There\\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\\'s.\"\\n\\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something\\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \\n\\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\\n\\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\\ncomputer industry?\\n\\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

One is a C program that will perform a \"morph\" between\\nany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then\\nit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out\\nto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions\\nand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would\\nlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply\\nperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary\\nobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know\\nan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the\\norigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there \\nmust be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because\\nI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new\\npoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However\\nthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is \\nappreciated.\\n\\nttknock@bbs.santafe.edu\\n\\n',\n",

You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image palette.\\n\\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\\n\\n>say,\\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\n>expected that the image still is the same. \\n\\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n>So, XV were designed\\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\n>program work -- design error.\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\n>major change to the original design.\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

       "  'From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro, Waikato University)\\nSubject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)\\nOrganization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\\nLines: 67\\n\\nOK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\\n-- \\nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\\nPhone: (317)494-6054\\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \\n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\\n',\n",

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\\n\\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\\n\\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\\n\\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\\na group.\\n\\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\\n\\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\\nsoftware, I\\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\\n\\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\\n\\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\\n\\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\\nmessage to the address:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn\\'t be too much of a\\ndelay in joining.  Expect a \"welcome\" message within 5 days after you\\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\\n\\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\\n\\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\\nfollowing address:\\n\\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean it hasn\\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\\ncouldn\\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\\naddress.\\n\\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\\n\\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\\n\\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\\nyou used to sign up:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\\nforwarding of the articles to you.\\n\\n\\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\\n\\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\\nrelates.\\n\\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\\n\\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\\nthe LightWave3D mailing list.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \\nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  Genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \\nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \\nare available on Genoa\\'s BBS at (408) 943-1231.\\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \\ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \\nIBM-compatible personal computers.

The most egregious example is that\\nrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently\\nin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on\\nall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared\\nto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --\\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored\\nby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also\\nnote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably\\ncompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that\\nnone of the FAX formats are really useful.\\n\\nWhat's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,\\ne.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have\\nprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses\\nbytes rather than pixels.\\n\\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\\nread all incoming TIFF files.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

There are other\\nalgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations\\nare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).\\n\\nA variant method is described in \"Graphics Gems\", p. 287-293.  Note that\\nthe code from the \"Graphics Gems\" series is all available from an FTP site,\\nas described above.\\n\\nCheck out John Bradley\\'s \"Diversity Algorithm\", which is incorporated into\\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\\n\\nThe ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as \"doing a better job than the\\nother algorithms, but slower\".\\n\\nThere\\'s also an implementation of:\\n\\nWan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data\\nClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),\\npp. 153-162.\\n\\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.

All of the packages mentioned can do\\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\\n\\n\\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\\n\\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\\nsub-pixel sampling.\\n\\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster\\nRotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\\nInterface \\'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\\nin \"Graphics Gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\\n\\n\\n7) Free image manipulation software.\\n\\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\\nHere are pointers to some of them:\\n\\n    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format\\n    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing\\n    of GIF files, among others.

See item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\\n\\nYou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at\\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,\\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check both.\\n\\nFITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\\'s a file format most\\noften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images\\nbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\\n\\n\\n\\n9) Converting between vector formats.\\n\\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\\nPC\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\\'s X11/NeWs can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  But in general, the\\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.

The approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\\n\\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\\n\\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\\n\\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves\"\\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\\n\\n\\n12) How to order standards documents.\\n\\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\\ncomplete name and number.\\n\\nSome useful numbers to know:\\n\\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\\'s Hierarchical\\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\\n\\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\\nat 1-800-854-7179.\\n\\n\\n13) How to FTP by email.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\\' article in\\nGlassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\\n\\n\\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\\n\\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\\neach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>\\nhas posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.\\nIt\\'s available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.\\n\\n16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.\\n\\nRick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:\\n\\nHighlights of this edition-\\n\\n    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through\\n       November \\'91;\\n    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG\\n        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, \\'91;\\n    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;\\n    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;\\n    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.\\n\\nThe bib is in the form of a PostScript file.

It is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\\'t like\\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\\n\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\\n\\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\\n\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\\nmessage containing any or all of:\\n\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nSend a message containing \"help\" to get general information about the\\nmail server.\\n\\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\\n20 above for more information.\\n\\n\\n22) What is morphing?\\n\\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\\n\\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\\n\\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\\nuncompress them afterwards.\\n\\n\\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\\n\\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\\nget their own FAQ section.

Zhao)\\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\\nOrganization: University of Houston\\nLines: 159\\nDistribution: world\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu\\n\\n\\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\\n------------------------------------------------\\nPostal Address:\\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\\nFax: (408) 991-3773\\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\\n\\n\",\n",

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])       # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
